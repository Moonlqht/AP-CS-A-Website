# How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This project was created using HTML and small amounts of CSS to streamline production process and assist in reusing tags for simplicity. Interactive features were created using Javascript, such as hover detection for submenus and a darkening navigation bar when scrolling. Its core feature is displaying section titles alongside text sections, built with HTML and CSS. The design allows additional boxes to be easily added using the same HTML IDs, ensuring scalability and dynamic adjustments.

# Challenges

The most challenging part was creating the navigation bar, involving element formatting and animations. This issue was solved by darkening the screen based on the screen's y-position.
