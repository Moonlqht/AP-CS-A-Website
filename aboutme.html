                <h1>My Coding Experience</h1>
                <p>I started off exclusively programming in Python, though I expanded my knowledge of languages to Java in 8th grade. In the future, I'd like to be more proficient in HTML/CSS/JS and start learning C++, a language that I heard is great when doing competitive programming. <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/user/Moonliqht/solved" target = "_blank">Here</a> is a link to my DMOJ profile. </p>

                <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games such as tetris and VALORANT. I also spend my free time doing math, either studying by myself or grading math homework for a tutoring school. Additionally, I love learning about technology, completing DMOJ problems in my free time and learning about hardware components. Besides video games and academics, I also play tennis, participating in my school's tennis team.</p>

                <p>The two computer science contests I have participated in so far are USACO and CCC. So far, I've achieved Silver division in USACO, along with perfect score on CCC Junior and 32 on CCC senior. Attached is a screenshot of my current USACO profile. </p>
